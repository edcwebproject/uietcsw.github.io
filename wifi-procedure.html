			How to get Wi-Fi?
		</h2>
		<div class="wtf">
			Wi-Fi here at PU is probably the only thing you will love.
			#notbeingsarcastic.
			But getting it is also a difficult task. <br>
			Since you are freshers you probably are gonna get it after you get your ID Card, as you need to
			attach its photocopy along with the wifi form. But here we have a heads up on how to go about it.<br>
			<p>
				<code>1.&nbsp;</code>First of all, find a senior who has access to PU Wifi network. The wifi portal opens only through
				the PU network. Ask him/her to simply help you fill the Wifi form ( People are very helpful here ). Once
				they have filled your form, just ask them to mail it to you and get a hard copy (printout) of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>2.&nbsp;</code>Get a photocopy of your ID card and attach it with the form. Sign wherever applicable on the form.
				Above the place where it says "Verified by Office", get signed by any teacher who knows you. If that doesn't work,
				then go to the office in Block-1 and get it signed by someone there. <code>#allthebest.</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>3.&nbsp;</code>This form after signed needs to be submitted to anyone in the Server Room that is on the first floor in Block-1.
				Remember to visit the room before 1PM as you may find God someday, but the server manager, he is....never mind. Just remeber to
				submit the form to him.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>4.&nbsp;</code>In a couple of days, you will get a mail containing your Login ID and Password on the same mail ID you
				used to register earlier. Connect to the following wifi:<br><br>
				<span><code>SSID&nbsp;:&nbsp;PU@CAMPUS</code></span><br>
				<span><code>Password&nbsp;:&nbsp;1234567890</code></span><br><br>
				Now, a notification will tell you to Sign In to the connected network. Open the dialog box and enter the Login ID
				and Password that you received in your mail in it. Once connected, you are good to go.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>5.&nbsp;</code>One of the major disadvantages of this wifi is that you have to login again everytime
				you connect to the network that is entering Login ID and password everytime, which is devastating, but thanks to our seniors as they have
				found a perfect solution to this problem. Use their app to add your profile and simply login with one touch. Download any one from here ( Both have the same functionalities ):<br><br>
				<span><code><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saru.pulogmein&hl=en">PULogmein (For Android)</a></code></span><br><br>
				<span><code><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=simararora.puautologin&hl=en">PU Auto Login (For Android)</a></code></span><br>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<strong>Here are somethings you should know about the PU wifi</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Although social media sites and apps work flawlessly on it, media such as videos, mp3 etc. are
					blocked from downloading.Youtube works good. This means videos won't work on Facebook(App or Browser) or Instagram (not even stories).</li>
					<li>Any explicit content leads to blocking of your UserID so be careful with that.</li>
					<li>The Wifi registration lasts for about an year, so every time you have to perform the same procedure.</li>
				</ul>
